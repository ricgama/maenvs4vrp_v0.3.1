Prize-Collecting Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (PCVRPTW)

This version of the CVRPTW does not require visiting all clients. Instead, each client has a prize that is collected upon visitation (see, e.g., [Bal89]_).
The objective is to minimize the total combined traveled time of all vehicle routes while maximizing the collected prizes.
