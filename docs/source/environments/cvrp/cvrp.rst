Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)

In the CVRP, a fleet of vehicles is dispatched from a depot to serve a set of customers with known demands. Each customer can only be served once by a single vehicle, and each vehicle cannot exceed its capacity at any point. Vehicles must start and end their routes at the depot (see [Dan59]_).

The objective is to minimize the total combined traveled distance (or time) of all vehicle routes.
