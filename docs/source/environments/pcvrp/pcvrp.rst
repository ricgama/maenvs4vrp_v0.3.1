Prize-Collecting Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (PCVRP)

In the PCVRP, a fleet of vehicles is dispatched from a depot to collect profits from a set of customers. Not all customers need to be visited (see, e.g., [Bal89]_); the objective is to maximize the total collected profit while respecting vehicle capacity constraints. Each customer can be visited at most once by a single vehicle, and each vehicle must return to the depot when its capacity is exhausted.

The objective is to maximize the total profit collected across all vehicle routes.
