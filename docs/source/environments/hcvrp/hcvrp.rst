Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (HCVRP)

In the HCVRP, a fleet of heterogeneous vehicles is dispatched from a depot to serve a set of customers with known demands. Unlike the standard CVRP, each vehicle has its own individual capacity and travel speed. Each customer can only be served once by a single vehicle, and each vehicle cannot exceed its individual capacity. Vehicles must start and end their routes at the depot (see [Li22]_).

The objective is to minimize the total combined traveled time of all vehicle routes.
